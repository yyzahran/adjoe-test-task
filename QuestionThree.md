### Prioritization based on quick assumptions

My assessment of prioritizing the 5 cases is as follows (highest to lowest):
1. The email register function in the app does not work with Samsung mobile
phones

This seems like a blocker bug given that is affects a crucial functionality such email registration that can deter potential clients from using our service. It also affects the world's largest manufacturer of Android smartphones which is Samsung. A potential work around would be for these users to use their desktop devices, but that is not something that can be guaranteed that all user can or would do.

This can greatly affect our business and should be prioritized to be fixed as soon as possible as I'd give it high priority and high severity.

2. The mobile backend servers must be upgraded to support load peaks

This issue/ticket can be a potential blocker during load peaks; we have to make sure that our mobile app can handle increased traffic, avoiding downtime and maintaining performance during high demand periods. This can be handled second to make sure all the customers have a seamless experience using our app at any time. This is a ticket of medium severity and high priority in my opinion, it's not a blocker, but it's important to get it fixed or handled quickly.

3. The Dashboard for the Daily KPIs analysis in the marketing department does not
work properly

Having working KPs analysis dashboard must be critical to the marketing team as it must be essential in decision-making. However, it's an internal issue and can be handled after the customer-facing previous issues are fixed. Also, through proper communication and better analysis of the issue, this can be bumped up as second if needed (for example, if the marketing team need the dashboard right away for a marketing campaign), but for now and given the information given, I give it third place. If anything, I reckon we can still pull data needed by the marketing team using our APIs, so there might be a workaround there. That being said, I give it medium priority and medium severity.

4. A/B Testing the influence of a faster image loading function in the mobile app

This is a ticket probably to improve the image loading speed to enhance the users' experience and retention on mobile devices. Since there're no metrics given in the ticket's title, I will assume that it is an improvement and that the current loading speed is not an issue or a blocker in a way. If it is a blocker, I'd bump it to number three and get to switch places with the current third place. Enhancing the user experience is always a good thing, but not on the expense of broken pieces of the product as the previous issues imply. I give it low severity and medium priority.


5. Head of Design wants to change the layout of the App to the new CI

This ticket is cosmetic in a way, nothing in the title implies that something or a functionality is broken, it's good to update the layout for sure but not on the expense of the previous tickets. This ticket can hold on till the rest are fixed, if anything, it can be fixed before the fourth if need be as it's an improvement after all and not technically a bug. I give it low severity and low priority.
